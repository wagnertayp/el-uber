-----> Python app detected
 !     Error: Couldn't find any supported Python package manager files.
 !     
 !     A Python app on Heroku must have either a 'requirements.txt',
 !     'Pipfile' or 'poetry.lock' package manager file in the root
 !     directory of its source code.
 !     
 !     Currently the root directory of your app contains:
 !     
 !     app.py
 !     attached_assets/
 !     build_css.py
 !     generated-icon.png
 !     .gitignore
 !     instance/
 !     main.py
 !     models.py
 !     package.json
 !     package-lock.json
 !     payments.py
 !     postcss.config.js
 !     Procfile
 !     pyproject.toml
 !     .replit
 !     replit.nix
 !     runtime.txt
 !     static/
 !     tailwind.config.js
 !     templates/
 !     uv.lock
 !     
 !     If your app already has a package manager file, check that it:
 !     
 !     1. Is in the top level directory (not a subdirectory).
 !     2. Has the correct spelling (the filenames are case-sensitive).
 !     3. Isn't listed in '.gitignore' or '.slugignore'.
 !     
 !     Otherwise, add a package manager file to your app. If your app has
 !     no dependencies, then create an empty 'requirements.txt' file.
 !     
 !     If you would like to see support for the package manager uv,
 !     please vote and comment on these GitHub issues:
